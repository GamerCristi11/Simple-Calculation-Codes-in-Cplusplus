## What you will need
### For linux/Ubuntu
In the terminal, first make sure everything is updated by typing:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
After that, install the following programs:
```bash
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install g++
```
### For MacOS
Install XCode Command Line Tools
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
### For Windows
Install a code editor like:
- MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows):

  Download it from [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)

  Install the necessary packages, especially the g++ compiler.

  After installation, use Command Prompt to compile and run your programs.

- CodeBlocks:

  Download it from [CodeBlocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/)

  It's an IDE with built-in compilation support, making it beginner-friendly.

- VS Code:

  Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

  Use extensions like "C/C++" for syntax highlighting and debugging.

  Pair it with MinGW or another compiler for execution.

## Get the code

### On linux
In the terminal, type:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GamerCristi11/Simple-Calculation-Codes-in-Cplusplus.git
cd Simple-Calculation-Codes-in-Cplusplus
```

### On MacOS
Go to [this link](https://github.com/GamerCristi11/Simple-Calculation-Codes-in-Cplusplus/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
Now, after installing, unzip the file.
After that, find the path for the unzipped file and in the terminal, type the following command, replacing "path/to/file" with the actual path
```bash
cd path/to/file
```

### On Windows
Go to [this link](https://github.com/GamerCristi11/Simple-Calculation-Codes-in-Cplusplus/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
Now, after installing, unzip the file.

## Codes
After that, now you should have 4 code files and a readme.md file. You can ignore the readme.md and even delete it as it's not important.
Here are the codes that you can run:
- Sum of 2 numbers(file: sum-of-2-numbers.cpp, name: sum-of-2-numbers)
- Difference of 2 numbers(file: difference-of-2-numbers.cpp, name: difference-of-2-numbers)
- Multiplication of 2 numbers(file: multiplication-of-2-numbers.cpp, name: multiplication-of-2-numbers)
- Division of 2 numbers(file: division-of-2-numbers.cpp, name: division-of-2-numbers)
### Before running them on Linux and MacOs, you need to enter the command, replacing name-of-file with the name of the file that you can find above :
```bash
g++ -o name-of-file name-of-file.cpp
```
### On Windows, you can open the folder that you have after unzipping the zip and open it in the code editor that you choose and run the code.
